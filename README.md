   How to use Tip Calculator 
   Type “Bill 200” : to calculate the amount of tips
   Type “History Tip” : to view the list of history tips.
# Key Points of Focus
The reason why I chose LINE as platform is that it is easy to launch apps and can easily share the total amount and amount of tips by inviting group account. 
In contrast, application might take time to launch it and has to constantly update version.
It is able to quickly to calculate the total amount of bill and tips. 
Create tip history so that users can stores total amount and amount of tips. 
# Future Improvement
I was not able to rich menu for this project because I was aiming to learn Python, AWS services, and MySQL, not designing the menu. 
But I will create the rich menu to improve user friendly of the application. 
This is because users must type “Bill ” or “History Tip” to start calculate the total amount of bill and tips. 
Users might be frustrated to use the apps by mistyping the command. The rich menu would improve user experience because users are only require to start calculating the total amount of bill and tips. Also, it would be better to implement custom percentage of tips because it currently have only tipping 10%, 15% and 20%. This is because not only every users choose those percentage of tips, but they don’t also tip any percentage of bill whereas more than 20% as well.
